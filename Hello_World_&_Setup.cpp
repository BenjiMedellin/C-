using namespace std;                    // so we can use cout, cin without std::

}

/*
#include <iostream> : this is needed in order for output and input.
int main() : this is where the code begins for every C++. The int means the function will 
              return an integar. Just to confirm there is success we usually ask for a return 0.
'<<' : this is the symbole for stream insertion and sends data to our output.
'endl' : this is to indicate a newline or type '\n'.
Summary : the main point is that every C++ program will have a skeleton. include -> namespace -> main() -> return 0
